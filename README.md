The **QLab OSC Mimic** is a community-created plugin for
**[Linux Show Player](https://github.com/FrancescoCeruti/linux-show-player)**

This plugin causes LiSP to respond to some of the same OSC messages that
allow remote control of QLab.

This idea is that this should allow the use of mobile-device apps designed
for the purpose of remote controlling QLab to also control LiSP.


### Installation

To use, place the contents in a subfolder of `$XDG_DATA_HOME/LinuxShowPlayer/$LiSP_Version/plugins/`
(On most Linux systems, this will default to `~/.local/share/LinuxShowPlayer/0.6/plugins/`.)

When you next start **Linux Show Player**, the program should load the plugin automatically.
